##Choose your own adventure!!
----------------------  
The purpose of this project was to create a 'Choose
Your Own Adventure.' Using what we learned in class
we had to connect files that were both in the same 
subdirectory and in different folders. A major part of 
this project was to learn how to work together, and collaborate, as well how to solve and avoid merge 
conflicts, while still ensuring that everything worked.
